CREATE BACKUP

ONWARD TO INVENTORY

implement weapon, armor, accessory and an inventory screen

ALLOW CHOICE INTERFACE THROUGH LOG_WINDOW

pickable objects?
inventory to add picked object to
is picking a free action?

THE COMPONENTS FILE IS GETTING TOO BIG... SPLIT INTO MULTIPLE FILES GODDAMMIT...

spot_activate works good
BUT player is also activating from another tile when move_into event is made
fixed above by having a can_reach bool in activate_position event
when true can pick
else do other things like initiate dialog, melee etc

Currently we are not maintaining the original_intent in the goal subclasses
we will have to in the future

the longer files need to be split and organised... DO SOMETHING BEFORE UR HEAD EXPLODES FROM
HAVING TO REMEMBER ALL DETAILS 

Damage = ((((2 * Level / 5 + 2) * AttackStat * AttackPower / DefenseStat) / 50) + 2) * STAB * Weakness/Resistance * RandomNumber / 100

damage_formula in the pokemon games, random no= 85 to 100

picked entites are removed from the game engine... the inventory only passes them events it 
finds appropriate... so stuff like call_for_render simply dont reach inventory entities

adding or removing things to and from a list is problematic when you are already looping on it
make a custom list class?

activate_position sucks... write another targetted activate event and make necessary changes
