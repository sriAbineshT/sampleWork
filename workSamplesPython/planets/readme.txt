Introduction:
	** The program requires pygame. **
	The program is capable of simulating planetary motion and rendering the results on to a pygame window. The pygame window comes with two sub-windows. 	To control what each sub-window displays, use the controls explained here in the Controls section.
	There are three "planets" that are created in the default setup- 'SUN', 'EARTH' and 'MOON'. More planets can be created using the Planet class.
Controls:
	Q / W - ZoomIn / ZoomOut
	A / S / D - SpeedUp / Pause / SlowDown
	Z - ToggleDualWindowMode
	E - SwitchBetweenSubWindows
	Up / Down / Left / Right - PanScreen
Screenshot:
	There is a screenshot included intended to show the capability of the program. This has been done as the program lacks an user friendly ui.
